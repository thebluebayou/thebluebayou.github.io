      <description>One of my go-to recipes that I can make up in bulk and grab before I head out the door is this one for date and coconut balls. You can freeze them as well which is a bonus, but they will keep for a couple of weeks in an airtight container in the fridge. Depends how delicious you find them – ahem&amp;hellip;!!
 Ingredients:
 120g dates 80g jumbo mixed raisins 20g desiccated coconut, plus 2tbsps to coat 20g porridge oats A tablespoon of coconut oil   Method</description>
