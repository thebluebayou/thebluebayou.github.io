      <description>First Cross event in a couple of years, super course but much too hard for the first event of the year. The course was more suited to mountain bikes than CX bikes with quite a severe down hill section with large rocks to be avoided. All of the course was ridable , but I was a bit over geared for some of the climbs. Four 3 mile laps with 2 severe climbs made this a tough event.</description>
