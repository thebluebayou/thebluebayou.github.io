      <description>I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.</description>
