This is the cake I would choose above all others. It is my mother’s go-to cake, the one that was always on the kitchen counter. Although my wife made a few changes to the recipe, the essence &amp;amp; goodness are unchanged.
 Makes a 1kg (2lb) loaf cake Prep time 20 mins Cooking time 50 mins  Ingredients  2 tbsp whisky zest &amp;amp; juice of 1 lemon 2 apples (200g once diced skin-on) – I use Pink Lady apples 40g bitter chocolate (70% cacao works best here) 2 eggs 160g caster sugar 120g/130ml vegetable oil 150g plain flour 1½ tsp baking powder 1 tsp ground nutmeg 1 tsp ground fennel seeds (I always grind my own) a pinch of table salt  Method Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas mark 4.</description>
