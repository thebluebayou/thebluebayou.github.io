      <description>River Cottage head chef Gill Meller&amp;rsquo;s mushrooms, pastry and pancetta, taken from the Hugh&amp;rsquo;s Three Good Things on More4. Hugh&amp;rsquo;s recognised a simple pattern that underpins so many well-loved dishes – that they are little more or less than three good things on a plate and in this series, he pursues that idea, experimenting with different flavours and textures.
