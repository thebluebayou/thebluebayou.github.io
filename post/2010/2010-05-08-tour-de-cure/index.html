<h1>Tour de Cure</h1>Keith
<br><br>
<p>An early start was the order of the day for the 30 minute drive from Cork to Middleton and the start of the 2nd Tour de Cure endorsed by Stephen Roche one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest cyclists.</p>

<strong>Tour de Cure</strong></p>

<p>Arriving early was a god send, we parked in the railway station right next to sign on, and then where able to sign just before the masses arrived. After signing on and collecting our jerseys we headed back to the car to await the start.</p>

<p>Lining up at the start with at least 1000 other eager cyclists, we were greeted with an icy cold north wind. Shortly before 9:00am Stephen Roche got us under way, Flo and I tried to keep near the front and at the same time shelter from the biting northerly wind. Once the neutralised section was past the pace picked up considerably and we stayed together almost to Youghal, the pace was becoming too much for Flo and the group was starting to split, so I dumped Flo and joined the faster riders as close to the front as I could.</p>

<p>The pace was fairly fast until we passed the lunch stop at Ballymacarbry, a group of about 30 of us didn&rsquo;t stop and we continued on with the pace rising yet again. I was able to stay with this group until we reached the climb of the Vee, shortly after the beginning of the climb I was dropped from the group but maintaining a steady pace and with the aid of a tail wind I was able to pass some of the original group including the two girls. As I went over the top I optimistically though I would catch the bunch on the descent, but a headwind and appalling road surface put paid to that. At the end of the descent my feet and back where killing me and later both girls would pass me back. It was now just a matter of finishing the last 25 odd miles and trying to stop from cramping. Finally the finish was in sight and as I rolled in Flo was just walking out of the car park finishing her 62 miles in record time I wasÂ  happy with my ride 105 miles at an average of 19.3 mph all in all a good day for us both.</p>
