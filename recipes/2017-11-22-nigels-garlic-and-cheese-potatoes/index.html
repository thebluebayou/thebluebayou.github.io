<h1>Potatoes with Garlic and Comté</h1>
<p>Should you not be able to get hold of Comté, a semi-firm cheese such as Fontina or Emmentaler will work just as well.</p>
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
<p><em>Serves 6</em></p>
<ul>
<li>smoked garlic 7 cloves</li>
<li>double cream 500ml</li>
<li>bay leaf 1</li>
<li>cloves 2</li>
<li>full-fat milk 200ml</li>
<li>Comté 150g</li>
<li>potatoes 4 medium, waxy fleshed (yellow)</li>
<li>butter 30g</li>
</ul>
<p>Peel the smoked garlic and cut it into paper-thin slices then put it into a medium-sized saucepan with the cream, bayleaf, cloves and milk. Bring the cream and milk mixture to the boil, turn off the heat, cover with a lid and set aside to infuse. Set the oven at 160C/gas mark 2-3.</p>
<p>Coarsely grate the cheese. Peel the potatoes and slice them as thinly as you can, using a mandolin cutter if you have one.</p>
<p>Butter a large, shallow baking dish or roasting tin. Place a single layer of potato slices over the base then add a handful of the grated cheese, scattered evenly over the surface. Add salt and black pepper and a little of the sliced garlic from the infusion, too.</p>
<p>Continue with more potatoes and the remaining cheese until you have used them all up, seasoning each layer as you go.</p>
<p>Pour the infused cream over the surface, then bake for 1 hour and 50 minutes to 2 hours, until the top is appetisingly brown and the potatoes are meltingly tender.</p>
