<p><strong>TO MAKE THE BASE:</strong>

<p><strong>TO MAKE THE QUICHE:</strong>
Chop up the pepper into 2cm squares. Place in a bowl with the vinegars and water, a little salt and pepper and set aside.  Peel and cut up the butternut into square chunks and place in a saucepan with a steamer and steam, or if you don’t have a steamer boil until soft - takes about 15mins.  Chop up onion and garlic and fry in a little olive oil until garlic is fragrant and onion is glassy.  Drain peppers and place onions &amp; garlic, butternut, feta, eggs, herbs and salt &amp; pepper in the bowl with the peppers and gently mix together with a metal spoon.  Pour into the baking dish on top of the baked potato slices and bake at 180°C for about 35 mins or until the quiche is cooked through. Check with a metal tester stick and when it comes out clean the quiche is done.</p>
