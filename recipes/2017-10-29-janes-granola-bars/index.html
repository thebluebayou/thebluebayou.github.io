<h1> Jane&#39;s Granola Bars</h1>
<p><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup white flour</li>
<li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
<li>1 1/2 tsp. baking soda, add more if you add a lot of extra ingredients…which I often do!!</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
<li>2 cups brown sugar (Splenda if desired)  (or honey…use less than 2 cups)</li>
<li>6 cups oatmeal ( I use Speerville oatmeal)..large flake oatmeal, as natural as you can find.</li>
</ul>
<p>MIX WELL THEN ADD:  3/4 cup oil and 1 cup of water and I always add 2 tsp. or more of cinnamon.  If the mixture is too dry, just add more water. ( I roll it flat with a rolling pin, in a cookie sheet with sides.  You can also press flat with your fingers…keep wetting your hands to keep the dough from clinging to you fingers!)</p>
<p><strong>OTHER INGREDIENTS AS DESIRED:</strong></p>
<p>craisins, raisins, dates, chocolate chips, sliced or slivered or ground almonds,(or any combination of nuts) sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax meal/seeds, oat bran, wheat bran, peanut butter powder, chia seeds or anything you want or have around!</p>
<p>If adding mashed bananas, decrease some of the water,</p>
<p>if adding peanut butter, decrease some of the oil.  If using honey, take out the brown sugar and decrease  the water….it is a very adjustable recipe, just make it the consistency that you can spread in a pan.</p>
<p>This recipe fills 2 large rimmed baking sheets.  Lay a sheet of parchment paper on the cookie sheet so it covers the bottom and sides.  (if not using the paper, oil the cookie sheet) .  Press into pan.</p>
<p><strong>METHOD</strong>
BAKE UNTIL GOLDEN&hellip;&hellip;(20-25 MINUTES) AT 375 degrees.</p>
<p>Cut into bars when you take them out of the oven.  Let them cool in the pan.</p>
<p>Once baked, the bars will be like a cookie, will last a long time and can be frozen.  They are OK in a baggy on a hike/ride but will get crumbly.   I have used a vacuum sealer the last few times I made them….and you have seen the results…they are moist  and stay together well.  I did top my last ones with “maple sugar flakes”…but I don’t think they need it (makes for a crunchier topping after baking but that is destroyed by the vacuum sealing)…and I don’t think you could find them in Ireland anyway.</p>
