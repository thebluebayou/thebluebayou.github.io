<h1>Date and Coconut Balls</h1>
<p>One of my go-to recipes that I can make up in bulk and grab before I head out the door is this one for date and coconut balls. You can freeze them as well which is a bonus, but they will keep for a couple of weeks in an airtight container in the fridge. Depends how delicious you find them – ahem&hellip;!!</p>
<p> <strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>120g dates</li>
<li>80g jumbo mixed raisins</li>
<li>20g desiccated coconut, plus 2tbsps to coat</li>
<li>20g porridge oats</li>
<li>A tablespoon of coconut oil </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<p>Place the dates and raisins in a food processor and pulse until the mixture starts to stick together. Add the coconut, oats and coconut oil and give the mix a quick blast to combine. Take small handfuls of mixture, about 12g each, and roll into balls in the palm of your hands. Spoon 2tbsps desiccated coconut into a bowl and then toss the balls in the mix to cover completely.  Don&rsquo;t stress too much if your measurements aren&rsquo;t exact, so long as they bond well together you&rsquo;ll be fine!</p>
