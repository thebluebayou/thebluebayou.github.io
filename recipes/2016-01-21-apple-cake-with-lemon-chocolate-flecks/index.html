<h1>Apple Cake with Lemon &amp; Chocolate Flecks</h1>
<p>by Sarit Packer &amp; Itamar Srulovich from Honey &amp; Co. The Baking Book
(Saltyard books)</p>
<p>This is the cake I would choose above all others.  It is my mother’s
go-to cake, the one that was always on the kitchen counter.  Although my
wife made a few changes to the recipe, the essence &amp; goodness are
unchanged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes a 1kg (2lb) loaf cake</li>
<li>Prep time 20 mins</li>
<li>Cooking time 50 mins</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp whisky</li>
<li>zest &amp; juice of 1 lemon</li>
<li>2 apples (200g once diced skin-on) – I use Pink Lady apples</li>
<li>40g bitter chocolate (70% cacao works best here)</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>160g caster sugar</li>
<li>120g/130ml vegetable oil</li>
<li>150g plain flour</li>
<li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1 tsp ground fennel seeds (I always grind my own)
a pinch of table salt</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="method">Method</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas mark 4.</p>
<p>Butter a 1kg (2lb) loaf tin &amp; line the base &amp; long sides with a sheet of
baking parchment, making sure that there is enough of an overhang to
ease removal of the cake later.</p>
<p>Mix the whisky in a bowl with the lemon juice &amp; zest.</p>
<p>Cut the apples in small cubes (the size of playing dice) &amp; toss them in
the whisky mixture.</p>
<p>I like to leave the peel on, especially when using the red-skinned
apples, as it looks so pretty in the final result.  Set aside until
later.</p>
<p>Chop the chocolate into slivers like little flecks &amp; set in the fridge
to stay cold.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, or using a mixer with a whisk attachment, whisk the
eggs with the sugar until they start to puff up &amp; go pale.</p>
<p>Slowly pour in the oil until it has all been incorporated.</p>
<p>Get rid of the whisk &amp; use a spatula or wooden spoon to fold in the
flour, baking powder, nutmeg, fennel &amp; salt to a smooth consistency.
Then fold in the diced apple &amp; whisky mixture &amp; finally fold in the
chilled chocolate flecks.</p>
<p>Transfer the batter to the lined tin &amp; bake for 35mins.  Turn the tin
around for an even bake, then leave for another 15-20 mins.  It should
be bouncy to the touch &amp; the house should be filled with the aroma of
baking apples.  Allow to cool in the tin for at least 15 mins before
devouring.</p>
<p>To me this cake needs no topping at all.  But if you are making it at
teatime &amp; you want to spoil yourself, whip up a small tub of double
cream with a tablespoon of whisky &amp; a tablespoon of icing sugar for a
double treat.</p>
